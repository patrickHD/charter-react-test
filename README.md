Small React app for Charter Spectrum Opportunity. Uses ES6, functional components, and efficient algorithm design. https://codesandbox.io/s/charter-coding-assignment-oq270

For this challenge, I looked at two solutions for calculating the totals. Either I could have many loops and variables along with simple data structures, or I could use a few loops and a complex data structure. I decided to go with a complex data structure since it would be more efficient algorithmically and would be advantageous in a real app since the data could be more easily reused elsewhere.
